# Testing

Tests are ran with Jest with code coverage included. There is some minor setup in `babel.config.js` and `jest.config.js` to get TypeScript and the DOM working nicely with Jest.

The tests are examples of how to use the exception/rejection listeners and also how to setup a basic fallback ui explaining a fatal error occurred.

To run the tests:

```
> npm run test
```
